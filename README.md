# Social Media Performance Report - My Thriving Child

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of My Thriving Child's social media performance on Instagram and Facebook, based on provided datasets and visualizations. The report evaluates engagement trends, reach, impressions, follower growth, and post type effectiveness, offering actionable insights and recommendations to enhance future strategies.

## Problem Statement
My Thriving Child aims to optimize its social media presence on Instagram and Facebook by understanding performance trends and identifying areas for improvement. The challenge involves analyzing historical data to uncover patterns in engagement and growth, addressing platform-specific strengths and weaknesses, and mitigating the observed decline in activity in 2025. The goal is to leverage successful past strategies and diversify content to sustain and grow audience interaction.

## Solution
### Performance Analysis
- **Instagram Engagement Trends**: Consistent engagement in mid-2024 (e.g., April 2024 with 15,175 engagements) highlights the platform's strength, driven by high-performing Static Posts. A significant drop in 2025 suggests reduced posting frequency or algorithm shifts.
- **Facebook Engagement Trends**: A peak in November 2024 (exceeding 70,000 Reach and Impressions) likely tied to a targeted campaign or seasonal event, followed by a sharp decline in 2025, indicating potential campaign cessation or audience fatigue.
- **Reach and Impressions**: Instagram shows steady growth with peaks in April, July, and September 2024 (up to 50,000 Reach), while Facebook's peaks in September and November 2024 reflect successful paid efforts with minimal organic impressions.
- **Follower Growth**: Instagram experienced negligible growth from February to November 2024, with spikes in December 2024 (60 followers) and February 2025 (over 140 followers), followed by a decline in March 2025.
- **Post Type Comparison**: Static Posts outperform Reels with over 50,000 engagements versus 10,000, suggesting underutilization of Reels.

### Insights
- Instagram's mid-2024 success is driven by Static Posts and high Impressions-to-Reach ratios, indicating strong content resonance.
- Facebook's late-2024 peak suggests effective paid campaigns, while the 2025 drop may reflect a lack of organic strategy.
- Follower growth spikes correlate with potential campaigns or events, offering opportunities for replication.

### Recommendations
- **Content Strategy**: Replicate Instagram's April and September 2024 Static Post successes and Facebook's November 2024 campaign. Enhance Reel production with trending audio and calls-to-action to boost engagement.
- **Posting Schedule**: Maintain consistent posting in 2025, targeting peak months (September for Instagram, November for Facebook) to sustain growth.
- **Campaign Optimization**: Analyze November 2024 Facebook campaign details and December 2024/February 2025 Instagram growth drivers to inform future paid and organic efforts.
- **Diversification**: Balance Static Posts with optimized Reels to leverage Instagram's video algorithm, potentially increasing overall engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for charts depicting engagement, reach, and follower trends.
- **Data Analysis**: Manual interpretation of provided datasets and visualizations.

## Key Metrics to Track
- Engagement (Likes, Comments, Shares), Reach, Impressions, Engagement Rate, Follower Growth, Profile/Page Visits, Video Views, Shares/Saves, Post Type Metrics, and Click-Through Rate (if ad data is available).

## A/B Testing Approach
- Define goals (e.g., CTR), isolate variables (e.g., ad creative), run tests in Facebook Ads Manager for 5-10 days, analyze results for statistical significance, and scale winning strategies.

## Additional Analyses
- Post-level data for precise comparisons, audience demographics, content categorization, conversion tracking, competitor benchmarking, sentiment analysis, time-based posting optimization, campaign attribution, and predictive modeling.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals Instagram's mid-2024 strength and Facebook's late-2024 success, with opportunities to recover 2025 performance through strategic content replication and diversification. Further data on campaigns and demographics would enhance these insights.
